# discrete total curvature

A universal total curvature estimation method that works for both triangle meshes and point clouds.

## Dependencies

eigen

openmp

polyscope

libigl 

libigl is slightly more involved than the other libraries. We referred to the example project of libigl.

The only dependencies are STL, Eigen, [libigl](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/) and the dependencies
of the `igl::opengl::glfw::Viewer` (OpenGL, glad and GLFW).
The CMake build system will automatically download libigl and its dependencies using
[CMake FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html),
thus requiring no setup on your part.

To use a local copy of libigl rather than downloading the repository via FetchContent, you can use
the CMake cache variable `FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_LIBIGL` when configuring your CMake project for
the first time:
```
cmake -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_LIBIGL=<path-to-libigl> ..
```
When changing this value, do not forget to clear your `CMakeCache.txt`, or to update the cache variable
via `cmake-gui` or `ccmake`.

## OS

The code is developed on MacOS.

## Compile

Compile this project using the standard cmake routine:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This should find and build the dependencies and create a `example_bin` binary.

## Run

From within the `build` directory just issue:

    ./TotalCurvature

A glfw app should launch displaying the point cloud of a cow, rendered with color representing total curvature of each point.
